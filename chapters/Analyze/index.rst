Analyze
=======

Pro, Ultra, and Enterprise account holders have the ability to create custom reports in the Analyze section, which can aid in whipping your data into shape. The benefits of customized reports are for earier data management, and data analysis, all the while ensuring a pretty journey is maintained. Some of things you can accomplish are:

	1. Create Reports similar to a Microsoft Word document
	2. Export or Share Reports with your colleagues
	3. Alter Chart Items to match your analysis needs

As a result, this chapter will teach you all of the things you can accomplish, as well as provide a basis for becoming the next big hit at your meeting.

Report Dashboard
----------------

To begin the process, click on the [Analyze] icon in either the Editor, or on the Survey Dashboard page to the right of the survey you wish to build custom reports. The first time you go to the "Analyze" section, you will see the Report Dashboard. This is where you see a list of existing reports. By default, there are zero reports in a newly created survey.

	*Figure 9.1* Survey Statistics

Under Survey Statistics, you’ll see the survey length, the number of individuals who’ve completed the survey, the completion rate (number of completions/number of starts), the average completion time, the estimated completion time and the average number of responses per day.

	*Figure 9.1* Responses Per Day

The Responses per Day chart outlines the amount of responses received on a particular date. Using the image above as an example, you can see that on June 10, 2011, roughly 30 
respondents completed the survey in question. Likewise, on June 05, 2011, the completion rate was closer to 60.

In addition, the Statistics section contains a geographical map which indicates where the majority of the responses came from. In the image above, the primary source of responses 
originated in Canada.

   * - Section
     - Description
   * - 1. Checkbox Questions
     - Closed-ended questions can only have certain chart items. Otherwise, "Invalid Data Source Selected" will appear if something other than, *"Bar Charts"*, *"Chart Tables"*, *"Tables"* is used. The default choice is *"Chart Tables"*
   * - 2. Multiple Choice Questions
     - A Multiple Choice question, being close-ended, can only have certain char items, such as, *"Pie Charts"*, *"Bar Charts"*, *"Chart Tables"*, *"Tables"*. The default choice is *"Chart Tables"*
   * - 3. Grid (matrix) Questions
     - N-Atrix and 3D Matrix questions adhere to a Grid format. Therefore, only *"Bar Charts"* and *"Tables"* are available as a charting item. The default choice is "Tables"
   * - 4. Open-ended Questions
     - Since a response from an open-ended question can range from precise, to vague, there are only specific charting types available; *"Include Inline"*, ie., Include the responses with the chart item, and *"Include Appendices"*, ie., Include at the end of the Report in the Appendix. The default choice is "Include Appendices"
   * - 5. Table Statistics
     - IF the "Tables" chart item was included, by default both counts (choices) and percentages (scores) are included.
     	* [Include both counts and percentages] will show both selected choices, and percentage of selected choices compared to the rest
     	* [Include percentages only] will only show the "Percentage" 
     	* [Include counts only] will only show the "Count"
   * - 6. Include Section Separators
     - If a survey contains various Section Separaters as question resources that is crucial to understanding either the response, or the gathered data, then a Report can include those separators. By default, this option is unchecked.

A report will have various options available which are a click away. The Actions button contains actions unique to that Report, such as:

* Share Report
* Duplicate Report
* Delete
* Export to PDF 
* Export to Word
* Export to PowerPoint
* Export to Excel

Multi-Lingual Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a survey contains 1 of 72 languages, a Report can be created to strictly represent said language. You can add French, German, Bulgarian, or even Bengali, to your survey. There’s no limit on the number of languages a survey can have, and when you create a multi-lingual survey, the subsequent report will also have multi-lingual functionality.

If for instance, your survey has both French and English language support, you’ll be able to view and create reports in English and French. To do so, go into the “Reports” section under “Analyze” and select “French” from the dropdown, as seen below.

After clicking “Create Report”, a newly created French report will be at your disposal. Subsequently, any new items added into the Report will be in the selected Report language. 
The same process can be followed for any other languages that have been added to the survey.
